## Flocking Simulation

This project is a simple flocking simulation based on boids algorithm by Craig Reynolds. This testbed is used to tune the flocking behaviour in 2D environment and test predator evasion strategies.

In addition, this is my toy project to learn basics of React and relearn some JavaScript.

Live demo available [online](https://mcdevon.github.io/flocking-simulation).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
